# COVID-19-Healthcare-Misinformation

## Background and Model usage
As the coronavirus spreads, misinformation related to COVID-19 also spreads. Such information has caused confusion among people, disruptions in society, and bad consequences. So the goal is to understand, detect and mitigate the fake news.

## Dataset
- 5,975 confirmed fake and true news articles with ground truth label
- 15.95% news are fake
- Link to the dataset: https://github.com/cuilimeng/CoAID

## Modeling process
- Combine files and create labels
- Create TFIDF
- Stratified train/test split
- Apply sampling methods to train dataset
- Train models on training dataset
- Evaluate models on testing dataset

## Sampling methods:
- Simple oversampling: just duplicates examples in the minority class, and these examples donâ€™t add any new information to the model
- SMOTE: synthesizes new examples for the minority class
SMOTE improves 18.9% relatively on Recall

## Evaluation methods:
Recall: The proportion of actual positives was identified correctly.

## Model performance:
- Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines with grid search models were fit and tested.
- Gradient Boosting Machines with grid search yields the best performance (Recall: 0.705).
- ROC Curve for the best model \

## Future works:
The dataset also contains users' social engagement (Tweets and replies) about such news. But only IDs are provided due to Twitter's privacy policies. 
Future work will be scapping the cotent of the tweets and replies and see if the information can be fit into the model and improve the performance.
